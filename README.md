# LaunchpadOG

### The classic Launchpad. Reimagined.

After the latest macOS update, Apple replaced Launchpad with a simplified apps viewer through Spotlight. **LaunchpadOG** brings back what was lost — the clean grid of icons, the fluid transitions, and the simplicity that made the original Launchpad so iconic.

## Overview

**LaunchpadOG** is a lightweight, open-source macOS app built in SwiftUI. It faithfully recreates the look and behavior of the original macOS Launchpad, focusing on speed, minimalism, and usability.

No added complexity. No distractions. Just Launchpad, the way it should be.
